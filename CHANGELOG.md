## ‚ú® Features & Enhancements

### 1. Full-Stack User Authentication & Authorization
- **Backend Login Endpoint:** Created a secure `/api/auth/login` endpoint to handle user authentication.
- **Password Security:** Implemented `bcrypt` for hashing and comparing passwords securely.
- **JWT Implementation:** The login endpoint now generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login, which is used to authorize subsequent API requests.
- **Frontend Login Page:** Built a polished, responsive Login page using React and Material-UI, complete with form validation and error handling.
- **Global Auth State:** Developed a React `AuthContext` to manage the user's authentication state, token, and role across the entire application.
- **Persistent Sessions:** The user's session (token and user data) is now stored in `localStorage` to keep them logged in after a page refresh.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Implemented middleware on the backend to protect routes based on user roles (e.g., 'Administrador').
  - The frontend navigation bar now dynamically displays links (like "Usuarios") only to authorized users.

### 2. Live Data Dashboard
- **Backend Statistics:** Created a new `usp_GetDashboardStats` stored procedure and a corresponding `/api/dashboard/stats` endpoint to fetch real-time system statistics (total users, vaccines, etc.).
- **Frontend Dashboard:** Developed a visually appealing Dashboard page that fetches and displays these live statistics in Material-UI cards, complete with loading and error states.

### 3. User Management Module (Admin-Only)
- **Backend User List:** Corrected and deployed the `usp_GetUsers` stored procedure and created a protected `/api/users` endpoint to provide a list of all system users.
- **Frontend User Page:** Built a new "User Management" page that displays all users in a clean, sortable Material-UI table.
- **Administrator Account:** Successfully created a new administrator account (`admin@vaccinationsystem.com`) to allow for system testing and management.

## üêû Bug Fixes & Troubleshooting

- **Server Management:** Resolved numerous issues related to the backend and frontend servers interfering with each other, ensuring both run simultaneously without conflict.
- **API & Database Corrections:**
  - Fixed a critical bug where the login endpoint was missing from the backend.
  - Corrected the frontend `authService` to send a `POST` request instead of a `GET` request during login.
  - Fixed incorrect column names in the `usp_GetUsers` stored procedure to match the database schema.
- **Environment & Configuration:** Resolved issues with environment variables not loading correctly in scripts by providing explicit paths.
- **CORS Errors:** Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the backend to allow the frontend application to make API requests.
